**Novelos Partners with Writers' Centres to Deliver "Voice-First" AI Tools for the Modern Storyteller**

**[CITY, STATE] – [DATE]** – As writing communities navigate the complex landscape of artificial intelligence, **Novelos** has launched a new "Novel Operating System" designed specifically to support the educational and creative missions of Writers' Centres. Unlike generative tools that replace the writer, Novelos acts as a digital mentor, helping members refine their craft, understand story structure, and amplify their unique voice.

"Writers' Centres are the heartbeat of literary culture, and their members are rightly concerned about AI erasing their identity," says Thomas Corfield, creator of Novelos. "We built Novelos to be the antidote to generic AI. It's a tool for workshops, mentorship programs, and solitary writers that functions like a tireless developmental editor, not a ghostwriter."

**A Virtual "Writer-in-Residence" for Every Member**

Novelos offers features that align perfectly with the curriculum of creative writing workshops:

*   **The Craft Coach (Manuscript Mode):** Instead of auto-completing text, the integrated AI analyzes a writer's draft to provide feedback on specific craft elements. Members can run a "Show, Don't Tell" check, analyze their pacing, or review dialogue authenticity. It’s like having a tutor available 24/7 to reinforce lessons learned in seminars.
*   **The Beta Reader Simulator:** For writers who can't afford professional assessments, Novelos simulates feedback from diverse reader personas (e.g., "The Cynical Critic," "The Genre Purist"). This helps emerging writers toughen their skin and spot weaknesses before submission.

**The "Own Your Tools" Philosophy**

In an era of endless subscriptions, Novelos takes a stand for author independence.
*   **One-Time License ($79):** Novelos is software you own, not a service you rent. There are no monthly fees.
*   **Bring Your Own Key (BYOK):** Users connect their own Google Gemini API key. This ensures authors pay only for what they use (often pennies per novel) directly to the provider, rather than an inflated subscription markup.
*   **Privacy First:** Novelos stores data locally or on the user's own cloud drive. No training data is harvested.

**Structuring Success: From Idea to Industry-Ready**

For Centres offering "Plotting" or "Novel in a Year" courses, **Assembly Mode** serves as a powerful organizational companion:
*   **Interactive Outlining:** Writers can test character arcs and plot beats against industry standards using the Pacing Heatmap.
*   **The "Crucible" for World-Building:** A dedicated space to organize messy workshop notes into a coherent story bible.
*   **Professional Polish:** The Synopsis and Marketing tools help members prepare professional query packages, bridging the gap between art and industry.

**Workshop-Ready Portability**

Recognizing that many Writers' Centres utilize shared computer labs or have members working across different devices, Novelos includes **Noveli**—a portable, single-file word processor included with every license.
*   **Zero Installation:** Runs in any browser from a USB stick.
*   **Privacy First:** No data is stored on shared machines.
*   **Take It Home:** Members can start work in a centre's computer lab and continue seamlessly at home without expensive software licenses.
